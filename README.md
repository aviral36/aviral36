### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I code in Python, but have tried my hands on various other languages and technologies too. You'll find my projects here. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my pet project [piplada](https://github.com/aviral36/piplada).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I' not a software engineer by profession. I'm a mathematics student, but I love to code!
